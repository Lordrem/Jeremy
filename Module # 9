Basic visualization:

x <- Salaries$yrs.since.phd
y <- Salaries$salary
z  <- Salaries$rank
plot(x, y, main = "Academic Salary by years since phd", xlab = "Years Since Phd", ylab = "Salary Growth", color = z)

Ggplot2:

ggplot(Salaries, aes(x = yrs.since.phd, y = salary, color = rank)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Academic salary by years since degree")

Lattice:

xyplot(y ~ x, main = "Academic Salary by years since phd via lattice package", xlab = "Years Since Phd", ylab = "Salary Growth", col = z)
